%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

[[http://webdav.org][WebDAV]] stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users
to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers. 

This module contains a full Class 2 !WebDAV implementation for Apache 2
=mod_perl=. It uses a standard abstraction of the server filesystem,
allowing it to be used with a wide range of different filesystems,
including (via the FilesysVirtualPlugin) the Foswiki datastore.

Integration with <nop>Web<nop>DAV means that users can edit topics and
attachments using an appropriate <nop>Web<nop>DAV enabled client program,
such as Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Open Office, etc. When used
with the companion WebDAVLinkPlugin, you can embed links to !WebDAV
resources in Foswiki pages that will open the linked documents in
native applications.

!Foswiki permissions are honoured throughout.

Use of the FilesysVirtualPlugin means that all the data views supported by
that module are available to !WebDAV clients, so clients can read and write
Foswiki topics as text, as HTML, as a JSON data structure, or as any other
view supported by FilesysVirtualPlugin.

(Note: This module is a completely new implementation for Apache 2, and
does not share _any_ code with the old !WebDAVPlugin).

---++ Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.

---+++ Step 2: mod_perl configuration

Create the file =%CONFPATH%/tools/WebDAVContrib_mod_perl_startup.pl= with the
following content:

<pre>
use lib '%CONFPATH%/bin';
do 'setlib.cfg';
1;
</pre>

This tells !WebDAVContrib where you want to run Foswiki from.

---+++ Step 3: Apache configuration 

Add the following to your Apache configuration (must be included into the
base configuration; will *not* work in =.htaccess=)

This exposes the  =%CONFURL%= path on your server. You can change this location
to whatever you want, but make sure the =FoswikiLocation= matches it.

<pre>
PerlRequire "%CONFPATH%/tools/WebDAVContrib_mod_perl_startup.pl"
PerlLoadModule Apache::FoswikiDAVHandler
&lt;Location "%CONFURL%">
    SetHandler perl-script
    FoswikiLocation "%CONFURL%"
    FoswikiFilesysHandler Filesys::Virtual::Foswiki
    PerlHandler Apache::FoswikiDAVHandler
&lt;/Location>
</pre>
This will configure DAV *without authentication*, so all transactions will use
the "guest" login. See "Configuring authentication" below for information
on configuring web server authentication.

Restart your apache server. 

---+++ Step 5: Test

The path http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL% should now show you all your root
webs, when viewed from a DAV-enabled client.

The best way to verify your server is working is to use a simple, reliable
!WebDAV client program such as =cadaver= (available for most platforms
- you can get a Windows version from
http://www.phtagr.org/2009/04/01/cadaver-for-windows/ **).

Run =cadaver= and open the DAV folder on the server:
<pre>
dav:!> open http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%
dav:%CONFURL%/> ls
Listing collection `%CONFURL%/': succeeded.
Coll:   Main                                4096  Mar 25 12:42
Coll:   Sandbox                             4096  Apr  6 08:19
Coll:   System                             20480  Apr  7 10:32
...
dav:%CONFURL%/> cd Sandbox
dav:%CONFURL%/> put packages.txt LoremIpsum.txt
Progress: [===================>] 100.0% of 320 bytes succeeded
dav:%CONFURL%/> cat LoremIpsum.txt

        muspimerol.gif                  2800  Apr 12 14:38
</pre>
If cadaver reports any errors, check your apache error log on the server.

You can verify that the !LoremIpsum topic has been created by going to %SCRIPTURL{view}%/Sandbox/LoremIpsum.

=user="BaseUserMapping_666"= shows that the creation of the !LoremIpsum topic and the subsequent uploading of the =muspimerol.gif= attachment was done using the !WikiGuest user. If you try to do the same in the System directory, you will get a failure response:
<pre>
dav:!> open http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%
dav:%CONFURL%/> cd Sandbox
dav:%CONFURL%/> put packages.txt LoremIpsum.txt
Uploading packages.txt to `/dav/System/LoremIpsum.txt':
Progress: [=============================>] 100.0% of 320 bytes failed:
401 Authorization Required
</pre>

(At this point attempting to access the !WebFolder using Windows XP service pack 2 allows you to browse the folders, but opening any files will fail)

---+++ Step 6: Configuring authentication

If you configured your server as described above, it will be configured *without* authentication. That means that all transactions will happen as the "guest" user. In most cases you will want to require a login by the client, so that the user can be identified.

To configure authentication you simply protect the folder using
an _Apache_ authentication method of choice. !WebDAVContrib will automatically
log in to Foswiki using the username (or Wiki Name) that was used to log in
to Apache.

For example, you could use Basic Authentication to protect the DAV folder,
using the password file used by the default Foswiki setup:
<pre>
PerlRequire "%CONFPATH%/tools/WebDAVContrib_mod_perl_startup.pl"
PerlLoadModule Apache::FoswikiDAVHandler
&lt;Location "%CONFURL%">
    SetHandler perl-script
    FoswikiLocation "%CONFURL%"
    FoswikiFilesysHandler Filesys::Virtual::Foswiki
    FoswikiDebug 0
    PerlHandler Apache::FoswikiDAVHandler
    %RED%AuthName "Foswiki"
    AuthUserFile %CONFPATH%/data/.htpasswd
    AuthType Basic
    &lt;LimitExcept OPTIONS&gt;
        require valid-user
    &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/Location>
</pre>
Restart the web server after any change to the Apache configuration.

<pre>

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\cadaver>cadaver.bat
dav:!> open http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%
Authentication required for Foswiki on server `%CONFHOST%':
Username: BillGates
Password:
dav:%CONFURL%/> ls
Listing collection `/%CONFURL%/': succeeded.
Coll:   Main                                4096  Feb 24 07:14
Coll:   Sandbox                             4096  Apr 10 00:51
Coll:   System                             24576  Apr  9 09:01
...
</pre>

Note that Basic Authentication is much more secure if used over
SSL (with https: URLs).

---+++ Step 7: Configuring FilesysVirtualPlugin
Refer to the documentation for FilesysVirtualPlugin for information on
configuring it to support different data views. Each data view presents
topics as a different file type, allowing you to read and write the same
topic in a range of different formats.

---++ Debugging

If you are having problems with !WebDAV you can enable tracing in the Apache
handler and the file system interface using the =FoswikiDebug= Apache
directive. Set this to:

   * 0 to disable tracing,
   * 1 to enable tracing in the filesystem (shows reason for failures)
   * 2 to enable tracing of !WebDAV requests.
   * 4 to enable detailed debugging

Trace information is output to the Apache error log. Note that the tracing
options are bits in a mask and can be combined.

---++ Linking to DAV resources from a web browser
To link to a DAV resource from a web browser, all you have to do is link to
the DAV url of the resource. However most browsers will open the link
in a "read only" mode. If you want to open DAV resources from Firefox
or Internet Explorer for editing using a DAV-aware native application
(such as Microsoft Word or Open Office) you can use the companion
WebDAVLinkPlugin.

---++ Accessing a <nop>WebDAV resource on Microsoft Windows

There are four ways to access !WebDAV folders from Windows:
   1 (Preferred) Use the *Add Network Place* wizard. Enter the URL of the folder e.g.
     <pre>http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%</pre>
   1 Mount a !WebDAV folder on a drive letter from the command-line 
     (a DOS box). <pre>
C:\> net use * http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%
Drive Z: is now connected to <nop>http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%.</pre>
   1 Via Internet Explorer (IE 7 or earlier), by following the File->Open menu and selecting
     "Open as Web Folder". Enter the URL of the folder e.g.
     <pre>http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL% </pre>
   1 Directly from an application, such as Microsoft Office. Type the full URL
     path to the document e.g.
     <pre>http://%CONFHOST%%CONFURL%/System/AccessControl.txt</pre>
Note that the DAV support on Windows is somewhat inconsistent. Some of the
above methods may not work on some versions of Windows, or when using SSL,
or with some types of authentication. These problems are not unique
to this !WebDAV implementation; the bugs are in the client, not the server.

   * For example, using !WindowsXP service pack 2, "Open as web folder" results in a standard windows share style authentication dialog which fails (doesn't even send a request to the DAV server), and then when you hit cancel, a different login dialog pops up - entering your Foswiki username and password here _works_

See http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/webdav-redirector-list.html and
http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/webfolder-client-list.htmlfor a list
list of the known bugs in different Windows versions. 

Don't forget to restart Apache :)

---+++ Web Folders

Note that only the !WebDAV Mini-Redirector has been tested with this plugin. If
you are using an older version of Windows you may find that it attempts to use
the _other_ Windows !WebDAV client. Look at your Apache access log and look for
the user-agent _Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV_. If you
see it then Windows is trying to use the old Web Folders implementation of
!WebDAV.

---+++ Problems with authentication

By default the Mini-Redirector will not talk to Basic authentication. This is
because Basic Authentication is very insecure over a plain connection. If your
server uses SSL, or you are behind a corporate firewall, you may consider it
safe to enable it by following the instructions at
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841215

Windows caches authentication aggressively. This is usually not a problem
unless you try and change authentication method, in which case rebooting
Windows usually works, though you may have to explicitly clear your caches as
well.

If a single folder is mounted on a server using DAV, the !WebDAV Mini-Redirector
assumes that the root folder on the same server is also mounted using DAV, and
will try to apply the same cached authentication to all sub-folders; so having
two sub-folders on the same server with different authentication schemes won't
work. This applies to all folders mounted via !WebDAV from a single server.

If you want to use Digest authentication, you will have to log in with an NTLM
domain name (e.g. =CORPORATE\myname=). The NTLM domain string is required in
the server password file (so Foswiki user =myname= needs to be in the digest
file as =CORPORATE\myname=).

---+++ Problems with Microsoft Office

Office uses the mini-redirector to access files stored in !WebDAV.

After opening a !WebDAV document in Office, you may see the message "Contacting
the server for information. Press ESC to cancel." in the application status
line. Office does not attempt to open any connections to the !WebDAV server
after an initial PROPFIND. Clicking ESC results in the message "Downloading
..." which again does not open any connections. Eventually after some minutes
the application may display the document, with no further communication to the
!WebDAV server. Research on Google suggests that this is a bug with the printer
driver in Office.

If the server does not support authentication, Office will always open
documents in "read-only" mode.

---++ Technical notes

All the standard [[http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/][Litmus tests]] pass
except locks:18 and locks:22. Note: the Litmus tests have to run with
=Filesys::Virtual::PlainPlusAttrs= due to the heterogenous way that Foswiki
handles web, topic and attachment resources (Web<nop>DAV assumes only two
resource types, collections and files).
